## Multi-scale Transformers with Adaptive Pathways for Time Series Forecasting (ICLR 2024)

## Introduction
 Pathformer, a Multi-Scale Transformer with Adaptive Pathways for time series forecasting. It integrates multi-scale temporal resolutions and temporal distances by introducing patch division with multiple patch sizes and dual attention on the divided patches, enabling the comprehensive modeling of multi-scale characteristics. Furthermore, adaptive pathways dynamically select and aggregate scale-specific characteristics based on the different temporal dynamics.
