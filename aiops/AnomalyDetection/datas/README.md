# SORN_DATA
1. The mutstangData.npy is generated from the open source dataset mutstang. We read the raw data by readMutstang function in utils.py and generate mutstangData.npy and we label the slowdowns and record it in mustangLabel.npy.
2. We also provide an example of Sync dataset. You can also generate a specified one by GenerateSyncData.py.
